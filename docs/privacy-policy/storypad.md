# Privacy Policy

**StoryPad** ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to safeguarding the privacy of our users ("user" or "you"). This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you access our mobile application (“App”). Please review this Privacy Policy carefully. **If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please refrain from accessing or using the App.**

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. Users are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about updates. By continuing to use the App after the revised Privacy Policy has been posted, you acknowledge and accept the changes and agree to be bound by the updated terms.

## Collection and Use of Your Information

### 1. No Collection of Personal Data

We do not collect any personal information, which includes but is not limited to your real name, address, email address, telephone number, geographical location, or any data stored on your device that could be used to identify you or other individuals.

As we do not collect personal information, there is no use, storage, or sharing of such data in any capacity.

### 2. Google Permissions

If you choose to sign in using your Google account, the App may access basic account information such as your name, email address, and profile picture URL, which will only be used within the App for display to you.

Additionally, if you grant the App access to Google Drive, it will create a dedicated folder within your Drive for storing application-specific data, such as your uploaded images and stories. This folder is private and accessible only to you. StoryPad does not have access to your entire Google Drive or any other files outside of this designated folder. It is stored exclusively in your private Google Drive folder and is never uploaded or shared elsewhere. We do not have the ability to read or access your stored data in any way.

### 3. Google Analytics

We utilize Google Analytics to collect and analyze aggregated data about how the App is used. This helps us better understand user behavior, improve functionality, and enhance your overall experience.

Important Note: Only non-identifiable data is transmitted to Google Analytics. The information collected does not include personal data and cannot be used to identify you in any way.

## Your Consent

By using this App, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
