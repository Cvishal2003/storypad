# What's the Difference?

Spooky was originally created as a more advanced replacement for **StoryPad**, but after two years, we've realized that **StoryPad’s simplicity is its greatest strength**. To maintain this clean and user-friendly experience, we have decided to focus our development efforts on **StoryPad** moving forward.

To continue receiving the **latest features and updates**, we recommend migrating your data to **StoryPad**. The migration process is **100% safe**, and your data will remain intact.

You can follow our step-by-step guide here:
