# Understanding the Difference Between StoryPad & Spooky

Spooky was originally created as a more advanced replacement for **StoryPad**, but after two years, we've realized that **StoryPad’s simplicity is its greatest strength**. To maintain this clean and user-friendly experience, we have decided to focus our development efforts on **StoryPad** moving forward.

To continue receiving the **latest features and updates**, we recommend migrating your data to **StoryPad**. The migration process is **100% safe**, and your data will remain intact.

You can follow our step-by-step guide here:

## Spooky is No Longer on Google Play 📌

We’ve unpublished Spooky from the Google Play Store to avoid confusion. However, updates will continue until there are no active users.

You can still download it directly from the Play Store by joining as a Beta user:
