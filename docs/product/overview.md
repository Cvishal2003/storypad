### Why Individual Add-ons (NOT Bundles) ⚠️

**Decision:** Keep individual $1.99 add-ons with promotional deals instead of bundling.

**Reasoning:**

- **Lower friction** – $1.99 feels less risky than larger upfront cost
- **User choice** – Customers only pay for features they actually want
- **Aligns with brand** – Matches minimalist philosophy over aggressive monetization
- **Infinitely scalable** – Works with 4 add-ons or 40 add-ons equally well
- **Higher conversion** – Impulse-buy rate is better at lower price point
- **Flexible promotions** – Use product deals (30-50% off) instead of complex bundles

**Why NOT bundles?** Adding more add-ons makes bundle pricing confusing and hard to maintain. Instead, we use rotating promotional deals on individual items—this scales infinitely without pricing chaos.

**See:** [Deals Strategy](./deals-strategy.md) for implementation details.

**Do not change this lightly** – it's a core part of StoryPad's positioning as a trust-first, user-friendly alternative to subscription-based apps.
