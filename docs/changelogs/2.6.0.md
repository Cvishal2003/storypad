# 2.6.0

## Simplify Changes History

To improve performance & reduce backups size, we’ve streamlined the story versioning system. Now, all previous change history will be removed & only 2 versions are kept:

- Draft Change – Your current work-in-progress
- Latest Change – The final saved version

Why this Change?

- Our goal is to make the app as simple as possible for everyday users, with less complexity and a smoother experience.

Benefits:

- Faster Performance: With fewer versions to track, the app runs smoother and faster.
- Smaller Backups: Reduced data storage means quicker backup times and less space used.
